# Interactive Templates

This repo includes basic templates for interactive content. Hopefully, this will be the starting point for future interactives and will cut down on repeatedly coding all the boilerplate.

## Large Interactive Template

This template is ideal for - drumroll please - large interactives. By that, I mean interactives with multiple pieces that can stand apart from a traditional story. Rule of thumb: If it's something that can be embedded into presto, this is not the right template.

The template is meant to mimic Presto's Longform template. It includes a large intro section with a background image and multiple "sections".

### Examples so far:
